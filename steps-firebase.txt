Built with Angular 4 on Cloud 9 and deployed on Firebase

Ensure you are using the latest version of node
nvm install node
nvm list
nvm alias default <number> (newest right now is 8, but use the first number of the version you just installed)
nvm use <number>

Install and use Angular CLI
npm install -g @angular/cli
ng new <project-name>
ng serve --host 0.0.0.0 --disable-host-check (to run and test locally; disable-host-check required for c9)
ng build --prod (to build dist directory for firebase) deployment

Install and use Firebase CLI
If you don't have one already, create a Firebase account, then create a new app with same name as your Angular app: Firebase
npm install -g firebase-tools
firebase login --no-localhost (--no-localhost required for c9)
firebase init (in angular project directory)
The cli will ask what folder to use as the public directory. Enter 'dist'
"Next it will ask if this is a single page app and if it should rewrite all urls to index.html. For our app select yes. If it asks to over write the index.html file, select no."
firebase deploy (select the matching app in the list presented)
